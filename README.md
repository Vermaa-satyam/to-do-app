# To-Do Application
Welcome to my To-Do Application project! This application offers a user-friendly interface for managing your tasks efficiently. Utilizing HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, this project aims to streamline your task management experience.

# Features Overview:
1.Check Off Completed Tasks: Just click a box to mark a task as done when you finish it. This helps you see what you've accomplished and what's left to do.
2.Delete Tasks: Need to get rid of a task? No problem! Click a button, and it's gone. This keeps your list tidy and easy to manage.
3.Automatically Saves Your Tasks: Your tasks are saved automatically in your web browser. So even if you close the app or turn off your device, your list will still be there when you come back.

# How to Use It:
Type your tasks into the box and click "Add". When you finish a task, just click the box next to it. If you want to remove a task, click the delete button next to it. Your tasks will always be there when you need them, thanks to the automatic saving feature.
